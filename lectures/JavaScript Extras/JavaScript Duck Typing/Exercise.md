_Use this playground to complete the following exercise:_


_[https://code.sololearn.com/#js](https://code.sololearn.com/#js)_


Create a function named **takeOff** that accepts a parameter such as an array of flying objects.



1. Create 5 variables 
    1. plane = “plane”, 
    2. sevenFiftySeven = “757”, 
    3. drone = “drone”
    4. shellPlane = null, 
    5. nothing = “”

and add them to an array named **flyingObjects**



2. Create a function named takeOff that accepts an array parameter
    6. Use a for loop to iterate through the array
    7. Use a if else statement to evaluate each variable in the flyingObjects array as a boolean - this will use truthy falsy
    8. If the variable evaluates to true, use console.log() to print that the variable “ is preparing for takeoff!”
    9. Else - the variable “ cannot fly”
3. Call the TakeOff function and pass in flyingObjects as a parameter
